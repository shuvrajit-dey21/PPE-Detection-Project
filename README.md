# Slow processing
# → Use Ultra Fast or Fast speed presets

# Dependencies missing
# → Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Attendance System Issues**
```bash
# Face not recognized
# → Check lighting, ensure model is trained, collect more face samples

# Attendance not recording
# → Verify employee is registered, check confidence threshold (≥55%)

# Camera freezing (FIXED)
# → All camera freezing issues have been resolved with async processing

# Import errors (FIXED)
# → All import errors have been fixed (date, theme colors, etc.)

# Database issues
# → Check attendance.db permissions, ensure sufficient disk space
```

#### **Export & Visualization Issues**
```bash
# Export not working
# → Install: pip install pandas openpyxl
# → Check date range selection and disk space

# Visualizations not showing
# → Install: pip install plotly
# → Fallback to basic charts if Plotly unavailable
```
